# Requirements

* python 3
* .pngs of your car skin
* folder path of your .pngs

# How to use

Clone the project and open in an editor (vscode etc.).
Execute tm.py with your path to the folders where your .pngs are. As so:

`python tm.py 'PATH'`

Replace PATH with your path, but let the quotations remain.

### Example
If my .pngs is in folder TEST01 with the path C:\Users\simon\AppData\Local\Temp\Rar$DRa8808.4239\TextureExport\TEST01

Then I execute `python tm.py 'C:\Users\simon\AppData\Local\Temp\Rar$DRa8808.4239\TextureExport\TEST01'`
